# How do I get started, what interfaces can I use?

To interact with a model it is recommend that you utilize one of the pre-existing interfaces that have been built by the open-source community.

These interfaces provide several handy features:
- A chat-like interface to interact with your model
- Swapping between prompt types to match the model being used
- Model re-training (currently Ooba only)
- Support for changing model parameters on the fly

There are a few interface options based on your particular needs:

##### text-generation-webui (aka Oobabooga)

Ooba is one of the most common user-interfaces for interacting with locally hosted LLMs. 

It also supports more advanced features like 4-bit support and the ability to train LoRAs.
