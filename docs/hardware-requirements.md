# What hardware requirements are there?

Like all hobbies, you can start small and expand out as you get into more advanced topics.

As a generic guidance, it is good for your system to have:
- A fast internet connection for downloading models
- Ample disk space to store models (can be 100GB+ if experimenting with models, datasets, etc.)
- Although a GPU is not required it can greatly improve the token generation speed and user experience.

### Starter Hardware Configurations

If you are just getting started with LLMs, you can use any recent desktop/laptop or even a Raspberry Pi to get you started learning the basics:

- Getting Familiar with Python
- Understanding Docker Deployments
- Deploying User Interfaces
- Basic Evaluation of Models

Although this setup can get you started, you may push the limits of a starter system if you are interested in more advanced topics:

- Fast token generation speeds
- Larger Models (>7B)
- Training Models
