# Models

Work in progress! If you are interested in contributing content, please go to our github repo and read our contribution.md file and make a pull request!

Listed below are the items we want on this page:
1. Where to find and download models
2. How does model size affect performance (with examples)
3. What is a fine tuned model vs a base model (with examples)
4. Basics of quanitzation
5. How do I know what models I can run?
6. Table of model size vs computation requirements (This will be a tricky one, ideally there are two tables, one for GPU inference and the other for CPU inference with some rough estimates)
