# Limitations
With models being smaller, its hard to get the same performance as the big models. We need to list out all of the drawbacks of current local LLM's and what's being done to improve them

Work in progress! If you are interested in contributing content, please go to our github repo and read our contribution.md file and make a pull request!

Listed below are the items we want on this page:
1. What is context length and the limiting factor
2. Why can't local llms perform as well as proprietary ones
3. Cost of training
4. Creating/getting access to high quality datasets. Cleaning datasets
