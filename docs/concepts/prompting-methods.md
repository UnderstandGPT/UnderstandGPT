# Prompting

Work in progress! If you are interested in contributing content, please go to our github repo and read our contribution.md file and make a pull request!

Listed below are the items we want on this page:
1. How do you steer a model to answer how you want? IE Providing context, or doing X-shot inference (providing examples of Q/A before asking the question for better structing)
2. Whats the difference between Chat vs Instruct mode with an example of what the outputs would like. Which one should you use?
3. Having a link to the training page if steering the model towards the answer you want isn't good enough
